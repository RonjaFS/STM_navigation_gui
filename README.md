# Gui Application to support a STM navigation system
 - The gui is build with the Godot engine to achieve high performance rendering of the navigation pattern.
## The navigation system
It is based on a binary pattern that can be scanned and identified with the stm and is drawn onto a silicon sample using Electron beam lithography. \
This gui is supposed to help moving the tip to the right position by showing the current location and the calibrated xy input necessary to reach the target location.
